## Purpose

This Website is designed to demonstrate my skills in basic Web structure and styling to future Employers as an aspiring Junior Web Developer.

## Functionality/Features

The Design of this website was to have a clear and concise layout for ease of navigation. I used landscape photography to create a more calming aesthetic and incorporate my personal interests.

Flexbox and Grid Displays were utilised to simplify the layout of the webpages, as well as basic transitions and animations for navigation and logo images. All pages are responsive for Mobile, Tablet and Desktop viewers.

- Home: This page contains the basic structure layout of all the pages on this website, a portrait photo of myself as well as a quote that I resonate with. It also includes navigation and clickable social links common to all pages.

- About: Utilising its own theme, this page contains information about myself as well as a little bit of my history. It also includes a PDF link to my Resume(still in progress).

- Projects: This is a page I intent to fill with projects after completing this website.

- Blogs: This pages lists five blogs, displayed in a grid format, that link to blogs with clickable pictures utilising animations. Please note the titles of the blogs are purely arbritrary.
  
- Blog-links: These five identical layout pages display blog information as well as featuring their own personalised background.
